            <p class='ab_para'>Growing up. I've always had a deep passion for innovative technology, new gadgets and japanese media. 
            At school I was the kid that was watching step by step PC builds on youtube , and html tutorials whilst my class 
            mates were still watching their favourite CBBC kids shows. I started off saving up enough money from local 
            newspaper rounds;  to build my own self built pc, and then got connected to the magical internet (back then it was aol dial up ! and sounded like a darlek from Dr Who).  Since then, I’ve grown a lot and other things have changed, 
            but my passion for coding, and dream to become a developer has always been ever present. In my my opinion 
            programming languages are the modern day equivalent to magic !. Now that I've started my programming journey; I feel I can relate to Alice in Wonderland
            when she went down the rabbit hole. It’s been a wild and crazy journey, 
            and I wouldn’t have it any other way!  
                    </p>
            <p class='ab_para'>
            After college, I successfully completed a Business Administration Apprenticeship at the NHS, and accumulated 5 years of valuable 
            customer service and business administration experience; which grew my soft skills and confidence. However, it has always been 
            my greatest regret to not have pursued a course like Computer Science or Computer Programming. The tech itch only grows stronger 
            and using CodeCademy to scratch that itch, and attending monthly coding meetups is simply not enough. 
            </p>
            <p class='ab_para'>
            Now I can proudly say ‘I am attending CodeNation 
            to grow my coding skills and hopefully achieve my dreams!’. I took my own steps to guarantee success in this amazing Coding Bootcamp, which 
            I’m genuinely loving. Before starting this course I successfully completed the Codecademy HTML/CSS and Javascript courses. 
            Whilst I know Codecademy by itself is not enough, I believe it has greatly helped me in CodeNation. I also had the enjoyable bonus of programming in 
            a new language; Python. Working in groups for the projects and making new friends was an invaluable experience, that I will look to further build upon.
            </p>
            <p class='ab_para'>
                    When I'm not coding I'm planning my next holiday, reading some new manga or working on photoshop projects. I also 
                    play for my local football team FC Bengal, and like to attend live sporting events. You might also see me in web development 
                    meet ups in and around Manchester. I find that they are a excellent source of motivation and pizza !
