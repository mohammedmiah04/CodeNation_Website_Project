            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p >
                Currently attending CodeNation Coding Bootcamp in order to pursue my dream of becoming a full 
                stack developer. Whilst building projects and growing more confident in this field, I have 
                already designed and maintained websites for my previous employers.
            </p>
            <p> Learning new programming languages and programs come swiftly to me; as
                I have a deep passion for technology. From my perspective; programming is the equivalent of 
                modern-day magic, an amazing tool which can make a positive impact on our world when creatively applied. 
                The addictive nature of self-learning and possessing a driven willingness to learn
                new computer languages has been one of my key strengths in pursuit of my dream to become a developer.
            </p>
            <p> My customer service and data processing skills are also excellent. I have experience creating a variety 
                of different professional business documents; including business correspondences, minutes, invoices, excel
                reports, graphs and photoshop flyers/posters. I posses great attention to detail and the ability to process 
                information quickly. Stepping up to my responsibilities, and multitasking is part of my daily routine. My 
                active aim is to create positive advancements wherever possible whilst carrying a positive attitude in 
                the work environment, and working harmoniously with my team.
